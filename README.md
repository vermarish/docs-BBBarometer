# Big Brother Barometer

This repository contains data analysis for the Big Brother Barometer project. 

An interactive summary can be found at [my Shiny website](https://vermarish.shinyapps.io/bigBrotherBarometer), and is generated from `viz_app.R`.

The in-depth details can be viewed at [my GitHub website](https://vermarish.github.io), and are found in `analysis.Rmd`.

For the actual Android app, see [the original BBB repo](https://github.com/vermarish/big-brother-barometer). This app is only used for data collection (as of March 4, 2021) and may one day be extended to a prototype keylogger.

The `docs` subdirectory contains notes for myself as I work through this project.

The `scratch_work` subdirectory contains old code that I used to troubleshoot errors and didn't have the heart to remove.
